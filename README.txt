# Tascii Video Converter

## What's in here?
The contents of this project make up a baseline demo of a video-to-ascii-animation converter, file format, and player written in python.

## Instructions:

### Playing Tascii Video
The demo video "tasciiflutterbear.text" can be played with ```*python tascii_player.py tasciiflutterbear.text```

### Creating Tascii Video - make tasciiflutterbear.txt
The converter is ascii_Video_converter_QwQ_v002.py. you can use ascii_Video_converter_QwQ_002.py on your own videos, but for demo purposes we have included tascii1.mp4, which you can convert to get a file identical to tasciiflutterbear.txt

Usage:
```bash
*python ascii_Video_converter_QwQ_v002.py tascii1.mp4
```
output.txt will hold a 10fps version of the video in the form of ascii frames each drawn out in their entirety in the text file. This is "technically" a shitty uncompressed video format. Compression is coming next.

### Why do you need this?
